# üçÅ AI Tutor GitHub Issues - Updated for Python + Airtable v0

## ‚úÖ **What We've Updated**

### **Streamlined for v0 MVP**
- **Simplified dependencies**: 8 core packages instead of 45+
- **Removed over-engineering**: No Vector DB, complex monitoring, or unnecessary infrastructure
- **Clear scope**: Focus on Issues 1-3 only for v0 validation

### **Updated Technology Stack**
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI (was Node.js/TypeScript)
- **Content**: Airtable integration (curriculum management)
- **AI**: Claude + OpenAI orchestration
- **Frontend**: React (simplified, no complex state management)
- **Deploy**: Vercel + Railway (simple, fast)

## üéØ **Key Improvements Made**

### **Realistic Scope**
- **v0 Goal**: Validate educational AI approach, not build production system
- **Timeline**: 1-2 weeks total, not months
- **Features**: Core chat with AI orchestration, not complex analytics

### **Clear Technical Specifications**
- **Exact file structures** for each component
- **Code examples** showing implementation approach
- **API schemas** and data models
- **Testing strategies** for each layer

### **Educational Focus**
- **Ontario curriculum alignment** with specific expectations
- **Canadian content** throughout all responses
- **Age-appropriate** language and activities
- **TODO markers** for hands-on learning

### **Student-Centered Design**
- **Student testing protocol** with real Grade 4 students
- **Success metrics** based on engagement and learning
- **Mobile-first** responsive design
- **Accessibility** considerations

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

1. **Run update scripts**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x update_github_issues.sh
   chmod +x update_sub_issues_complete.sh
   ./update_github_issues.sh
   ./update_sub_issues_complete.sh
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   cd ai_tutor/backend
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add API keys to .env
   ```

3. **Create Airtable base**:
   - Set up Ontario Grade 4 curriculum tables
   - Add Canadian examples and activities
   - Configure API access

4. **Begin parallel development**:
   - Frontend team: Issue #4 (React chat)
   - Backend team: Issue #5 (Python API)
   - Content team: Issue #6 (Airtable)
   - Integration team: Issue #7 (Testing/Deploy)

## üéì **Success Criteria**

**v0 is successful when:**
- Grade 4 student can have educational conversation about light/sound
- AI responds with age-appropriate, curriculum-aligned content
- Canadian examples appear naturally in responses
- TODO activities engage students in hands-on learning
- System is deployed and accessible via web URL
- Real student testing validates educational approach

**This validates the concept and justifies building v1!** üçÅ
